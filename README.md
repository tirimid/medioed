# medioed

## Introduction
medioed, or (Medio)cre Text (Ed)itor, is a text editor program I'm making
because I want to. The user experience should be somewhat similar to a less
configurable GNU Emacs.

## Dependencies
Software / system dependencies are:
* A shell environment for program execution

## Management
* To build the program, run `mincbuild`
* To install the program, run `./install.sh`
* To uninstall the program from the system, run `./uninstall.sh`

## Usage
After installation: either run `medioed` on its own to open the medioed greeter,
or `medioed file.txt other.txt ...` to open all specified files as buffers. From
there, edit the files as necessary.

## Contributing
I am not accepting pull requests from anyone other than myself. Feel free to
fork this project and make your own version.
